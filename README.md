.delegatecall() is a method in Solidity used to call a function in a target contract from an original contract. However, unlike other methods, when the function is executed in the target contract using

.delegatecall(), the context is passed from the original contract i.e. the code executes in the target contract, but variables get modified in the original contract.

Through this tutorial, we will learn why its important to correctly understand how .delegatecall() works or else it can have some severe consequences.

# 👮 Prevention
Use stateless library contracts which means that the contracts to which you delegate the call should only be used for execution of logic and should not maintain state. This way, it is not possible for functions in the library to modify the state of the calling contract.
